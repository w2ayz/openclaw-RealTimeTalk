## v1.1 — 2026-05-14

Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm deployment fixes — first successful live deployment on Pi 5.

### Fixed

- **`load_openai_key()` now resolves OpenClaw SecretRef objects.**
  The daemon previously expected `talk.providers.openai.apiKey` in `openclaw.json` to be a
  plain string. Current OpenClaw configurations store secrets as a SecretRef:
  `{"source": "file", "provider": "filemain", "id": "/providers/openai/apiKey"}`.
  The function now detects this pattern, reads the referenced secrets file
  (`secrets.providers.<provider>.path`), and navigates the `id` path to extract the key.

- **Audio resampling between hardware (48 kHz) and OpenAI Realtime API (24 kHz).**
  USB audio devices on Pi OS Bookworm (tested: USB PnP Sound Device mic, UACDemoV1.0 speaker)
  only support 44100 / 48000 Hz — not the 24000 Hz the daemon was requesting, causing
  `paInvalidSampleRate` on every session start.
  Added `DEVICE_RATE = 48000`, `RESAMPLE_RATIO = 2`, and `DEVICE_BLOCKSIZE = BLOCKSIZE * 2`.
  Mic input is now captured at 48 kHz and decimated 2:1 (every other sample) before sending
  to OpenAI. Speaker output received at 24 kHz is upsampled 2:1 via sample-and-hold before
  writing to the hardware stream.

- **Installer uses a virtualenv instead of `pip3 --user`.**
  Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm enforces PEP 668 (externally-managed Python), which blocks
  `pip3 install --user`. The installer now creates a dedicated venv at
  `~/.local/realtimetalk-venv` and points the systemd `ExecStart` at its Python binary.

## v1.0 — 2026-05-14

Initial release.

### Added
- `RealTimeTalk-daemon.py` — Python asyncio daemon connecting directly to OpenAI Realtime API WebSocket (no browser)
- Callback-based audio I/O via sounddevice / PortAudio; `AudioOutputBuffer` for thread-safe PCM streaming
- Server-side VAD turn detection; `whisper-1` transcription; live transcript logging
- HTTP toggle server on port 18790 (`/stop`, `/status`) for phone-browser control over Tailscale
- Internal reconnect loop — recovers from network drops, stops cleanly on SIGTERM or HTTP stop
- `RealTimeTalk-install-pi.sh` — one-command deploy: installs deps, writes systemd user service, enables linger, starts service
- `RealTimeTalk-toggle.sh` — `start | stop | restart | status | log | devices` SSH wrapper
- `--list-devices` flag to enumerate available PortAudio devices on target hardware
- `--input-device` / `--output-device` flags for explicit audio device selection
- `--http-port` flag to override default toggle port
